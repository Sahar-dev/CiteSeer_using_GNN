# CiteSeer_using_GNN

This project implements a Graph Neural Network for node classification on a citation network dataset.
## Introduction

This project explores the use of Graph Neural Networks for node classification tasks on citation networks. The GNN is trained on graph-structured data to predict the category of each node.

## Features

- Implementation of a Graph Neural Network for node classification.
- Graph preprocessing utilities.
- Training and evaluation scripts.
- Visualization of results.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- PyTorch
- torch_geometric
- NetworkX

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/gnn-node-classification.git
